## Accessibility of regulatory elements

### Input and Output

* Input file
    - List of promoters for DEGs
    - List of active enhancer for DEGs
    - List of Differential accessibile regions from section 5
* Output file
    - Regulatory element of DEGs with accessible changes

### Command

```R
# Input all required files
enhancer <- read.delim("./DEG_enhancer.txt",header = F)
promoter <- read.delim("./promoter_DEGs.txt")
ATAC_sig <- read.delim



```

### Result

Creating a plot to show the enrichment of DEGs with accessibility change in regulators
```R
library(clusterProfiler)
# Enrichment of GO term
temp_GO = enrichGO(gene         = temp_gene,# genename for all promoter and enhancer regulators
                OrgDb         = org.Hs.eg.db,
                keyType       = 'SYMBOL',
                ont           = "BP")
                
selected_pathways = c("leukocyte cell-cell adhesion","leukocyte migration","regulation of inflammatory response","regulation of leukocyte proliferation")

cnetplot(x = temp_GO,showCategory = selected_pathways,circular = TRUE, colorEdge = TRUE)
```
