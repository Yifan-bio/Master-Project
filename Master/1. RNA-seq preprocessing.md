## Transcriptome quantification

### Command
The study used salmon as transcriptome quantifier. However, an overall mapping rate of below 60% were found which is relatively low. However, we did suspect it as the GC content where showing contamination. Therefor, we will need to verify it.

```sh
# salmon quantification
salmon quant -i $index -l A -1 $R1 -2 $R2 -p 8 --validateMappings --gcBias --seqBias --recoverOrphans -o $output
```

In order to verify the unknown source, a second alignment were performed using hisat2. The results will tell us if the unknown transcripts were yielded from a human source or just random.

```sh
# trimming
trim_galore --paired --output_dir $trim_dir $R1 $R2
# hisat2 alignment
hisat2 -p 8 -1 $R1 -2 $R2 -S ./Output.sam
```
