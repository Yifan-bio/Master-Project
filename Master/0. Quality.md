## Package version
`fastqc v0.11.9`


## Employed dataset

The following figure shows us the quality of all fastq file that were incoporated during the study. WGBS and ATAC-seq has shown to suffer to the technique specific quality challenges which was accounted for during the processing of dataset. This bias includes high adapter sequencing rate and high duplication rate introudced by Tn5 tranposase during library extraction.

Figure 3.1. All employed datasets present qualified sequencing quality. The graph separately represents a) the per base sequencing quality and b) the mean sequence quality of all reads. All sequencing libraries were derived from 100 ng/ml PMA treated and untreated THP-1 cells collected from PRJNA53382. Expected contamination were found for both ATAC-seq library and WGBS library.
